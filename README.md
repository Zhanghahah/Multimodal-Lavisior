# Multimodal LLM for multi tasks: Towards AI for Chemistry and IQA

This repository holds the code and data of DrugChat: Towards Enabling ChatGPT-Like Cap Drug Molecule Graphs.


## Examples

![demo1](figs/examples/demo.png) 


## Introduction
- In this work, we make an initial attempt towards enabling ChatGPT-like capabilities on drug molecule graphs, by developing a prototype system DrugChat.
- DrugChat works in a similar way as ChatGPT. Users upload a compound molecule graph and ask various questions about this compound. DrugChat will answer these questions in a multi-turn, interactive manner. 
- The DrugChat system consists of a graph neural network (GNN), a large language model (LLM), and an adaptor. The GNN takes a compound molecule graph as input and learns a representation for this graph. The adaptor transforms the graph representation produced by the GNN  into another  representation that is acceptable to the  LLM. The LLM takes the compound representation transformed by the adaptor and users' questions about this compound as inputs and generates answers. All these components are trained end-to-end.
- To train DrugChat, we collected   instruction tuning datasets which contain 10,834 drug compounds and 143,517 question-answer pairs.



## Datasets

The file `dataset/IQA.py` contains cooked data for Supervised Instruction Tuning DatasetThe data structure is as follows. 

- {SMILES String: [ [Question1 , Answer1], [Question2 , Answer2]... ] }
- {<image> [Task descritor, answer]}


## Getting Started
### Installation
These instructions largely follow those in MiniGPT-4.

**1. Prepare the code and the environment**

Git clone our repository, creating a python environment and ativate it via the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/drugchat
cd drugchat
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate drugchat
```

Verify the installation of `torch` and `torchvision` is successful by running `python -c "import torchvision; print(torchvision.__version__)"`. If it outputs the version number without any warnings or errors, then you can go to the next step (installing PyTorch Geometric). __If it outputs any warnings or errors__, try to uninstall `torch` by `conda uninstall pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit` and then reinstall them following [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v1121). You need to find the correct command according to the CUDA version your GPU driver supports (check `nvidia-smi`). For example, I found my GPU driver supported CUDA 11.6, so I run `conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge`.


**2. Prepare the pretrained Vicuna weights**

The current version of DrugChat is built on the v0 versoin of Vicuna-13B.
Please refer to our instruction [here](PrepareVicuna.md) 
to prepare the Vicuna weights.
The final weights would be in a single folder in a structure similar to the following:

```
vicuna_weights
├── config.json
├── generation_config.json
├── pytorch_model.bin.index.json
├── pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin
...   
```

Then, set the path to the vicuna weight in the model config file 
[here](pipeline/configs/models/drugchat.yaml#L16) at Line 16.

### Training
**You need roughly 40 GB GPU memory for the training.** 

The training configuration file is [train_configs/drugchat_image_mol.yaml](train_configs/drugchat_image_mol.yaml). You may want to change the number of epochs and other hyper-parameters there, such as `max_epoch`, `init_lr`, `min_lr`,`warmup_steps`, `batch_size_train`. You need to adjust `iters_per_epoch` so that `iters_per_epoch` * `batch_size_train` = your training set size.

Start training the projection layer that connects the GNN output and the LLaMA model by running `sh image_mol.sh`. 

### Inference 
#### IQA task
**start infer, first find the trained ckpt like**
```
pipeline/output/pipeline_image_mol/20231024181/checkpoint_1.pt
```

**modify file inference configuration in line 11 [eval_configs/image_mol_infer.yaml](eval_configs/image_mol_infer.yaml), then run `sh inference_imgMol.sh`**

#### Laivisor
**To get the inference to work properly, you need to create another environment (`rdkit`) and launch a backend process which converts SMILES strings to Torch Geometric graphs.**

**It takes around 24 GB GPU memory for the demo.**

To create the `rdkit` environment and run the process, run
```
conda create -c conda-forge -n rdkit rdkit
conda activate rdkit
pip install numpy
python dataset/smiles2graph_demo.py
```
Then, the `smiles2graph_demo.py` will be running in the backend to serve the `demo.py`.

Find the checkpoint you save in the training process above, which is located under the folder `pipeline/output/pipeline_stage2_finetune/` by default. Copy it to the folder `ckpt` by running `cp pipeline/output/pipeline_stage2_finetune/the_remaining_path ckpt/with_gnn_node_feat.pth`. 

Now we launch the `demo.py` in our original environment. Make sure you have run `conda activate drugchat`. Then, start the demo [demo.sh](demo.sh) on your local machine by running `bash demo.sh`. Then, open the URL created by the demo and try it out!
